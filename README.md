# BTRFS Compressor

Uses BTRFS's internal compression algorythm to compress text files and other compressible files, in order to save disk space.

Not all files are compressed, only some file types, so that performance is not affected. Check the source for more details.

## Usage

```
  python compress.py <path(s)>
```
